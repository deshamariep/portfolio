                <h3>My design journey...</h3>
                <p>My journey into the world of design has been a transformative one, shaped by a lifelong fascination with creativity and expression. From my earliest memories, I've been captivated by the power of design to express emotion and shape perceptions. As a child, I was drawn to the world of fashion, dreaming of becoming a designer or stylist and using clothing as a canvas for self-expression. I vividly remember helping my mother pick out clothes and staging elaborate fashion shows for my dolls, relishing in the opportunity to bring my creative visions to life.</p>
                    <p>
                    As I grew older, my interests expanded beyond fashion to encompass a broader range of creative pursuits. In middle school, I discovered a passion for digital content creation, using graphic design to curate visual experiences for a music account I ran on Instagram. The account quickly gained traction, accumulating over 1.5k followers and providing me with a platform to showcase my artistic talents. However, as high school approached and academic pressures mounted, I made the decision to step back from this endeavor in order to focus on my studies.</p>
                    <p>
                    Throughout high school, my interests continued to evolve, leading me to explore new avenues of creativity and expression. While my academic focus remained on the sciences, I found myself drawn to a course in graphics and animation, re-immersing myself in the technical and artistic challenges of digital design. Despite my growing passion for design, I remained committed to my long-term goal of pursuing a career in medicine, envisioning myself as a future surgeon.</p>
                    <p>
                    However, life had other plans in store for me, as the sudden loss of my grandmother and the launch of COVID University forced me to confront unexpected challenges and uncertainties. During my freshman year at UC Davis, amidst the challenges of isolation and adjusting to online learning, I found myself at a crossroads. I began questioning my academic pursuits and how they aligned with my creative passions. It was during this time of introspection that I rediscovered my passion for design, sparking an interest in pursuing it as a potential career path.</p>
                    <p>
                    Reconnecting with my creative roots, I enrolled in graphic design classes and immersed myself in the world of visual storytelling and design thinking. Through these experiences, I discovered a newfound sense of purpose and direction, realizing that design offered me a unique opportunity to combine my passions for creativity, problem-solving, and human-centered innovation. As I continue to explore the diverse and exciting possibilities within the field of design, I am filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation for the journey ahead, confident in my ability to make a meaningful impact through the power of design.</p>
