                        <p>TAP Series is an industry-leading provider of 100% online, ANSI-accredited compliance training, specializing in courses like Food Safety Manager Certification that serve employers nationwide. Drawing on detailed user feedback, I identified key areas where the platform’s usability and system processes could be improved. I developed targeted UI solutions, then collaborated with the development team to implement them across core workflows.</p>
                        <p>Through these projects, I worked side by side with different teams to understand how each decision impacted both users and internal operations. Collaborating in an agile setting taught me to listen closely, adapt quickly, and design with clarity in mind. Whether improving admin workflows or refining customer-facing experiences, I focused on creating solutions that felt intuitive, practical, and connected across the system.</p>

Because only I or another team member could manually update names, we had to double-check that the student’s information was accurate and confirm they had not already started training.
