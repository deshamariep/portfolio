                <h3>By addressing user pain points and system inefficiencies, we created targeted solutions to <b>enhance the overall user experience, streamline workflows, and ensure better system integrity.</b></h3>
                <p>TAP Series is an industry-leading provider of 100% online, ANSI-accredited compliance training, specializing in courses like Food Safety Manager Certification that serve employers nationwide. Drawing on detailed <b>user feedback,</b> I identified key areas where the platform’s usability and system processes could be improved. I developed <b>targeted UI solutions,</b> then collaborated with the development team to implement them across core workflows.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <h3>1. Improving Post-Exam Clarity & User Trust</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Users completing the Food Safety Manager training were left <b>uncertain</b> about what to do next. The messaging after the practice exam was <b>vague</b>, especially for those who failed, and many users under our partnered Retail Grocery Stores’ encountered <b>login issues when transitioning</b> to the affiliated ANSI proctoring site. These gaps led to confusion, delayed certification, and an increase in customer support calls.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>The goal was to improve post-exam clarity, guide users based on pass/fail outcomes, and proactively reduce common technical issues during the exam handoff process. Additionally, to create a client-specific version for Albertson’s that aligned with their training standards.</p>
                <p>I rewrote the post-exam UI messaging, designed new guidance components, and collaborated with stakeholders to ensure alignment with training compliance and feasible implementation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>Solution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Designed outcome-specific messages:</b> separate UI messaging flows for users who passed and those who failed, each with <b>tailored next steps.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Added an instructional screen</b> before the ANSI link was shown, <b>helping users avoid common login issues</b> (e.g. email access, forgotten credentials).</li>
                    <li>Created a <b>custom version for corporate clients</b> (Albertson’s/Safeway) that met their internal compliance needs.</li>
                    <li>Ensured the design maintained visual clarity, used friendly tone and hierarchy, and stayed <b>consistent with the rest of the TAP system UI.</b></li>
                </ul>

                            <li>Separated Support and Help line reducing clutter and highlighting support information</li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Success message confirming training has been completed</li>
                    <li>Emphasized vital information with bolded or colored text</li>

            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>I redesigned key training flow screens to reduce confusion and improve user confidence during registration and exam transitions.

                <h3>2. Designing Secure Admin Workflows</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p><b>Problem:</b> After enrolling students, admins occasionally realized that names had been misspelled, <b>entered incorrectly</b>, or did not match legal documentation. However, <b>allowing unrestricted editing</b> of student names post-enrollment <b>posed a risk</b> — some users were modifying names to falsely represent training completion, potentially bypassing required certification steps.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>The goal here was to design a secure yet flexible system that allows for genuine name corrections while preventing misuse that could compromise the integrity of training records and certifications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>I was responsible for designing a solution that balanced administrative flexibility with system integrity. This involved understanding the misuse scenarios, gathering input from support staff, and creating a user-friendly flow that aligned with compliance standards.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p><b>Solution:</b> A <b>guided correction flow</b> that removed direct editing access from the admin interface after enrollment. I designed a pop-up that appeared when an admin attempted to edit a name, <b>providing clear instructions</b> on how to change a name through proper channels. This <b>ensured that errors could be corrected</b> while <b>preventing unauthorized or fraudulent modifications</b>.</p>

                <p>A guided edit workflow that allowed admins to correct student name entry errors without compromising data integrity or certification eligibility. This included an instructional pop-up that streamlined the correction process through proper support pathways. The update preserved training record accuracy, maintained system security, and reduced the risk of misuse while empowering admins to resolve mistakes efficiently.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p><b>Problem:</b> The marketing team and Managing Member needed a <b>faster way to scale email campaigns and generate learning materials</b> across multiple courses. Existing processes used design focused to HTML softwares, drafting study content was <b>time-consuming and inconsistent</b>, limiting the speed of outreach and content development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>The goal was to leverage design systems and AI tools to streamline content creation for email campaigns and learning materials, enabling the team to scale outreach and documentation without sacrificing quality or brand consistency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>I used ChatGPT’s project capabilities to generate structured drafts for both email templates and course study guides/syllabi. I developed HTML guidelines, then applied our internal design and brand standards to refine these drafts for clarity, usability, and visual consistency. I also set up a system for the marketing team to easily utilize the templates across their weekly email campaigns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="spaceBtwn">
                <p>Solution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leveraged ChatGPT to draft HTML email content and educational documents across multiple courses</li>
                    <li>Integrated brand-aligned layouts and tone standards into AI-generated templates to ensure a cohesive, user-friendly experience</li>
                    <li>Developed a repeatable workflow the marketing team used to send over 50,000 emails per week using these scalable templates.</li>
