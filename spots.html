                        <p>Initially, we faced challenges in formulating key questions to understand our users’ primary frustrations and motivations in housing searches. This crucial step guided us in prioritizing and developing features that addressed these pain points. During user testing, we realized the need to better communicate these frustrations through our feature design to enhance functionality. As we finalized our product features, it became crucial to seamlessly integrate them, ensuring a fluid user experience across the three pages. Despite our ambition to include numerous features, time constraints needed us to focus on the most impactful ones for our high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
