                <p class="boldText">Spots aims to reduce the stress and complexity of finding housing, making the process more manageable and cost-effective for students.</p>
                <p>A user-friendly housing app that streamlines the search for off-campus rentals while integrating social networking features.

                        <p>Our onboarding process is designed to create a personalized user experience right from the start. It begins with a brief introduction to Spots, followed by a compatibility quiz. This quiz asks about lifestyle choices, sharing preferences, and housing needs, helping us match users with ideal roommates and properties. By gathering these details early on, we ensure that users see housing options that best fit their specific requirements.</p>
