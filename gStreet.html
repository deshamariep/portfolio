            <h2>Impact:</h2>
                <p class="boldText" id="textSize">Sharing strategic recommendations to city officials, targeting the attraction of non-drinkers and families to G Street, informed by meticulous research and analysis.</p>
                <p class="textSize">My team and I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Davis residents to gain invaluable user perspectives, pinpointing a necessity for an engaging community-centric initiative in Downtown Davis. Proposing that the city consider implementing multiplayer activities, that facilitate interaction between those on G Street and are devoid of the need for alcohol to participate in.</p>

                        <div class="border">
                            <p>Considered to be the cornerstone of downtown Davis, it would be Second & G, where sits a small cluster of bars, restaurants and shops, as well as some nice outdoor seating for smokers and bar patrons.</p>
                            <p>In 2021 the city closed G Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets to vehicular traffic in efforts to support downtown businesses, especially restaurants, and keep them open during COVID-19 shutdowns. Opening the corridor on G Street to a pedestrian-only area raised some discussion about how to better the space allotted.</p>

                        <div class="border">
                            <p>The proposal for an arch to be rebuilt was brought up by the Davis Odd Fellows Lodge. The Odd Fellows organization of the City of Davis, California was established in Davis in 1870. The Davis Odd Fellows are part of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), a national and global organization focused on community support and charitable giving. The Lodge emphasizes camaraderie and community involvement and invites individuals with a desire to serve their community and humanity to apply for membership.</p>
                            <p>They emphasized the arch as a symbol of civic pride and unity. However, the Arch had a relatively short lifespan (1916-1924) and was demolished because it posed a hazard to the increasing automobile traffic.</p>

Mini-golf emerged as the preferred choice due to its alignment with our perspective—it's a multiplayer game, suitable for all ages, and can be enjoyed without the need for alcohol.</p>

            <p class="textSize">Initially, we faced challenges in formulating key questions to understand our users’ primary frustrations and motivations in housing searches. This crucial step guided us in prioritizing and developing features that addressed these pain points. During user testing, we realized the need to better communicate these frustrations through our feature design to enhance functionality. As we finalized our product features, it became crucial to seamlessly integrate them, ensuring a fluid user experience across the three pages. Despite our ambition to include numerous features, time constraints needed us to focus on the most impactful ones for our high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
